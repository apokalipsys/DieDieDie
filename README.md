# DieDieDie
An (not) useful dice library

This library defines a lot of things that you will never use to simply generate a random number.
It is not intended for serious business, but who knows. Maybe you are a serious dice roller that will use this.
If you really plan to use this, send me a tweet. I want to know what are you doing.

Feel free to report issues, ask for enhancements or features, etc. I will do my best.

## Usage
A simple 6 sides dice.
```java
Die myDice = new Die();
int aValue = myDice.roll(); //yay!
```

Did you say D&D?
```java
Die myDice = new Die(20);
int aValue = myDice.roll();
```

Navigating through the code you will find more entertaining ways to roll a dice.

## TODO list

* Complete documentation
* ~~Make a Fudge dice possible~~
* ~~Implement more statistically real dices~~
* Check if I copied a regular expression from somewhere, or I created my own before upload it.
